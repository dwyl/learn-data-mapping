Learn how to map data from one format to another (Extract - Transform - Load)

## Why?

Data comes in many different formats. Depending on what type of work
you're doing will largely dictate the type of data format that you will be
working with. This is why we're writing a tutorial to help you convert data from
one format to another.

## What?

We will be writing a series of ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) scripts.

These data formatting scripts will extract data from a given resource, transform
it into a specified format and then load the data into a database where it can be
accessed later.

## How?

Step 1 - Analyse the existing data set to determine the data types within the
data file
Step 2 - Convert the data types into the desired format
Step 3 - Load the data into a database

## Who?

Anyone who works with data.
